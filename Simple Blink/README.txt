Simple Blink

Intro to Embedded - Section 2

Simple blink is the opening goal for each MSP430 board in this lab. The task is to have any LED on the board to blink at a constant rate without end. For all of the boards listed below, the code was simply just a delay using a while or for loop that followed a change in state. The state turning the LED either on or off using an exclusive-or operator. Below is each of the boards, the only information that can be given beyond this is each of the pins used for LEDs.

* MSP430G2553
LED = P1.0


* MSP430F5529
LED = P1.0


* MSP430FR2311
LED = P1.0


* MSP430FR5994
LED = P1.0


* MSP430FR6989
LED = P1.0
