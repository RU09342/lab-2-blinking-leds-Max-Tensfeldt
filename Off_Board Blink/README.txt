Off Board Blink
Max Tensfeldt
Intro to Embedded – Section 2

The section was only using the G2553 board as it was the only one that could separate the processor and attach to a breadboard. The goal was to blink two LEDs on a breadboard using the chip to command them. First was power setup, this could be done by using jumper cables (Male to Female) to transfer power from the empty MSP430 board to the breadboard. The configuration of the breadboard can be seen in the photos attached in the OffBoardBlink folder. The way that information was sent over was through another set of jumper cables that attached the MSP’s RESET and TEST pins to the same pins on the chip located on the breadboard; this can also be seen in the picture of the program debugging and running directly on to the breadboard, a picture that Mr. Trafford suggest I take.
The pins used for the LEDs were the P1.0 and P1.6 pins. What I decided to add was a control button that was located on the breadboard entering the P1.3 pin giving the chip an input. The code had the P1.6 LED blinking at all times regardless of the button input. The blinking of P1.0 was controlled by the button similarly to the button blink section of the lab. This can be seen in the pictures taken; Mr. Trafford mentioned that considering that he was present to witness not only the data transfer, but the lab running personally, that pictures would suffice for visual aid/proof of completion.
