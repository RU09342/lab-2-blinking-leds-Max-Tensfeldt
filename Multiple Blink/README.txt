Multiple Blink
Max Tensfeldt
Intro to Embedded - Section 2

Now that simple blink has been completed, the obvious next step is to get multiple LEDs blinking. The task was to get two LEDs to blink out of sync from each other. For all of the following boards below, the code has them running one LED just like the simple blink portion of the lab, which can be identified as “normal speed.” Every third state change that the first LED goes through causes the second LED to change states. Below are listed the pins used for the LEDs over each board.

* MSP430G2553
LED running at “normal speed” = P1.0
LED running at 1/3 speed = P1.6


* MSP430F5529
LED running at “normal speed” = P1.0
LED running at 1/3 speed = P2.1


* MSP430FR2311
LED running at “normal speed” = P1.0
LED running at 1/3 speed = P2.0


* MSP430FR5994
LED running at “normal speed” = P1.0
LED running at 1/3 speed = P1.1


* MSP430FR6989
LED running at “normal speed” = P1.0
LED running at 1/3 speed = P9.7
